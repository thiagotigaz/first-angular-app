# first-angular-app
This repository has been created with the purpose of learning Angular JS.

Here I gonna share implementations of basic angular concepts I come across during the learning proccess.

Some of the code you guys gonna find here can have been retrieved from websites or youtube videos.
In those cases I gonna try to put refereces.
